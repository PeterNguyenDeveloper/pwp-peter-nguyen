    <h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>
    <h2>Purpose, Audience & Goal</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong>
        I want my PWP to enable developers to be able to create functional email forms on their static website
        without having to build a backend. The website is a landing page to demonstrate how to use this API endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Audience:</strong>
        Developers who are building static websites and need a way to collect user information. Employers who are
        impressed that I actually created a usable product.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Goal:</strong>
        The website will explain what the api does and how to use it. The website will show example code snippets,
        and a codepen playground that allows the user to edit and test out the api. This service will offer a
        straightforward solution for developers to create functional email forms on their
        static websites. Currently, there aren't many free options available for developers hosting static sites on
        platforms like GitHub Pages or Cloudflare Pages to collect contact information from users. The goal of this
        project is to impress potential employers and land a job. Regardless of the outcome, I want to build a tool
        that I can continue to improve and potentially monetize in the future. For example, I could offer a premium
        version with features like an email log dashboard, tables for managing collected form data, and additional
        email templates for paying customers. The possibilities are limitless. Depending on user adoption, I could
        even turn this into a profitable business, or sell the platform to another competitor.

    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Name:</strong>
        John Doe
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Age:</strong>
        25
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Profession:</strong>
        Web developer student.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Technology</strong>
        Macbook Air, with the latest OS, and a m3 chip.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong>
        Overloaded with course material, he doesn't have the time or energy to create a backend service for his
        contact form. Oh... one of his classmate is developing a solution? Ok, lets call upon their api.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong>
        John is developing a personal portfolio. He implemented an email form, because that's what everyone else
        did. He implemented the form, then he gets to the submit button, but it doesn't work. He
        can't figure out how to send himself an email. He asks the instructor. The instructor is like "bro
        you need a back end server to handle the submission". Lol, what?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Goals:</strong>
        John wants to submit forms without the headache of creating a backend server. So he found this easy to use,
        one line api integration that literally just works.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>User Story:</strong>
        As a user, I want to get my forms working with just 1 line of code.

    <h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>
    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>
        My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Introduction section</strong>
        Welcome the user with "Submit your HTML forms", with a "No backend" tag.
        Underneath is a "Create your Access Key" that scrolls down to the Create Access Key - Email Address form.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Code Example section</strong>
        An example code snippet of how to use this service, with a button in the top right corner to quickly copy the code.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Create Access Key section</strong>
        User can input their email address to receive an access key once they press the adjacent button
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>More in-depth Code Example section</strong>
        An example code snippet that includes additional tags like Honeypot Spam Protection
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Add Access Key section</strong>
        Re-iterate the importance of replacing the "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE" with the user's access key.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>That's it! section</strong>
        Shows how simple and quick it takes to implement this solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>FAQ section</strong>
        Frequently asked questions section, where I answer commonly asked question about this service.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Get Started section</strong>
        Another "Create your Access Key" button to scroll the user back up to the "Create Access Key section", in case they scrolled to the bottom and is sold on this idea and want to implement it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Footer section</strong>
        Will contain a site map that will link to different part of the website, as for the scope of the pwp, it will only map to the top, create a key, and the example contact form section.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Wireframes
    </h2>
    <p>
